// Written in the D programming language.

/**
 * $(D hap._random) is a _random number generation library for the D programming
 * language.  It is intended as a replacement for Phobos’ $(D std._random), and
 * addresses a number of issues encountered in that module: in particular,
 * $(D hap._random) implements _random number generators and related entities as
 * reference types rather than value types, which avoids a number of problems
 * that can arise with the standard library RNGs.  It is however largely derivative
 * of $(D std._random) and to the greatest extent possible implements the same
 * API, with some functional additions, notably the _random distribution ranges.
 *
 * The library name, $(I hap), is Welsh for “_random” or “chance”. :-)
 *
 * The functionality implemented by this package is divided into four
 * different groups:
 *
 * $(UL
 *   $(LI $(B _random number generators), deterministic pseudo-_random algorithms;)
 *   $(LI $(B _random distributions);)
 *   $(LI $(B _random adaptors), such as shuffling or sampling objects;)
 *   $(LI $(B traits) related to _random number generation.)
 * )
 *
 * The $(D hap._random) package will import all of the above functionality.
 * Alternatively, individual modules can be imported as required.
 *
 * Experimental functionality, not fully developed but available as a
 * technology preview, includes:
 *
 * $(UL
 *   $(LI $(B _random devices), non-deterministic sources of randomness.)
 * )
 *
 * This functionality will not be imported as part of the main $(D hap._random)
 * package but can be imported via the individual modules.  It should be used
 * with some caution, as its API may change significantly in future releases.
 *
 * Migration: To use $(D hap._random) instead of $(D std._random) it should
 * suffice to:
 *
 * $(UL
 *   $(LI replace $(D import std._random) with $(D import hap._random))
 *   $(LI insert $(D new) before every instantiation of an RNG.  For example,
 *     instead of $(D auto rng = Random(unpredictableSeed)) put instead,
 *     $(D auto rng = new Random(unpredictableSeed)).)
 *   $(LI optionally, the functions $(D randomCover), $(D randomSample) and
 *     $(D randomShuffle) may be replaced by $(D cover), $(D sample) and
 *     $(D shuffle); however, this is optional, not required.)
 * )
 *
 * Note: Currently only one function is known to produce different behaviour to
 * its $(D std._random) counterpart: $(D hap._random.distribution.dice) uses a
 * different algorithm to $(D std._random.dice).
 *
 * Warning: Bear in mind that non-reference-type RNGs used in conjunction with
 * this package will almost certainly generate erroneous results.  In particular
 * this package should not be used together with $(D std._random) itself.
